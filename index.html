                <h1>How <span>Jerome Edica</span> became a Developer at his young age</h1>
                <h2>Dated Posted: May. 28, 2023</h2>
                <img src="./assets/prog-img.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>I am <i>"Jerome Edica"</i>, and even as a
                    child, I was already fond of computers. I started using a computer when <em>I was 7 years old</em>. Because I
                    was mischievous in handling it, I ended up breaking my cousin's computer. Despite the things I
                    broke, I still managed to learn how to use it. Gaming was my passion when I was young, but I
                    continued to explore what else I could do with a computer. I even learned how to use Facebook at a
                    young age because I was curious about how technology works. As time went on, I learned more and was
                    able to do more. I also learned how to hack simple things like Wi-Fi when I was in elementary school
                    and how to find bugs in applications. I just recently discovered that it's called 'bug bounty,' and
                    I realized that there's a significant amount of money that can be earned from it. But it's okay
                    because at least I learned.

                    But how did I become a website developer or what they call a 'Front End Developer'? It started when
                    I was in Grade 9. I stopped studying in 2020, not only because of the pandemic caused by COVID-19,
                    but also because I couldn't afford to study in a private school. However, when I stopped, it didn't
                    occur to me to just rest all the time and watch or play games.

                    I thought about what I could do or what I wanted to learn to make good use of my time. I started
                    studying Ethical Hacking. I learned how to hack someone's basic identity, but of course, I was the
                    person I hacked. It was better to test it on myself for my own learning and not harm others. I also
                    learned how to create 3D models, basic animation, basic graphics, and other things because I also
                    enjoy designing houses and various things.

                    I stumbled upon website development when I became interested and serious about studying
                    cybersecurity. But of course, I'm not yet that skilled, and I'm still learning, so I'm still
                    curious. According to an article I read, learning website development is necessary, and there's a
                    point to it because if you know how to create a website, there's also a chance to learn how to
                    bypass one. And it's really important to learn Cybersecurity, at least the basics, so that we know
                    how to create a safe website.

                    I also proved that age doesn't matter when it comes to learning if you really want to learn. I
                    learned a lot on my journey, but I feel like I want to have companions or see people like me in this
                    field. That's why I thought of joining communities to grow alongside them and help each other
                    improve. That's where I met @Atcha_Abe, who became my elder sister in the community. Because of her,
                    I met many people, not just ordinary individuals, but big names in the IT field, and many skilled
                    individuals. This motivated me even more to work on projects to improve myself as well.</p>

                <h1>Life of a <span>Freelancer</span></h1>
                <h2>Dated Posted: May. 28, 2023</h2>

                <p id="big-artic"> Ang <i>"Freelancing"</i> ay isang uri ng trabaho na pwede pagkakitaan ng kahit sino
                    sa pamamagitan
                    ng pagbenta ng iyong skills. Ang halimbawa nito ay ang ginagawa ko kung saan may skills ako sa
                    pag-gawa ng website,pagdesign
                    ,pagsulat at kung ano ano pa na pwede ko pagkakitaan pag may nagpagawa sa akin.
                    Bilang isang Freelancer masasabi ko na hindi madali itong trabaho dahil una ay mahirap makakuha ng
                    client. Hindi ka basta-basta makakakuha ng client lalo't kung hindi maayos ang profile mo dahil isa
                    din yun na titignan at yung mga project mo na ginawa. Patunay na marunong o kaya mong gawin ang
                    kanyang pinapagawa kapag may napatunayan kana o na experience ito. Makakatulong ang pag-gawa ng
                    portfolio website upang maipakita sa ibang tao ang iyong magawa nagawa na project, upang patunay na
                    kaya mi gumawa ng mga ganung bagay at pwede ka nila i hire para sa kanilang project na gagawin. Ang
                    maganda sa Freelancing ay hawak mo ang oras mo at wala kang susundin na pinuno, dahil ikaw mismo ang
                    magdidikta ng iyong gagawin. Pero nakabase parin dapat ang project mo na gagawin sa pinapagawa ng
                    client mo para mabayaran ka niya ng maayos at posible ka bang bigyan ng magandang comment at rate
                    dahil sa katangian na pinapakita mo. laptop o cellphone at stable na internet connection ang
                    gagamitin natin, at dapat marunong tayo makipag-usap ng maayos sa client upang magtiwala sila sayo
                    at baka susunod ay bumalik sila sayo upang magpagawa muli. </p>

            <h1>The Project <span>AI</span></h1>
            <h2>Dated Posted: May. 28, 2023</h2>
            <img src="./assets/chat_AI.png" alt="">
            <p><em>Disover</em> the power of 'AI', Year 2023 kung saan naririnig ko at nakikita ang mabagskik na
                katangian ni chatGPT.
                Nag trending ito sa Tiktok,Facebook at sa ibang social media platform, nung una ay natawa ako kasi yung
                AI ay nakakausap nila through chat
                at sa mga usapan nila na nakakatawa na parang tao lang kausap. Tinry ko ito pag-aralan at nalaman ko din
                na OpenAI pala ang pangalan
                ng company na kung saan ginawa ang chatGPT, nakakamangha talaga sa kayang gawin nito. Hanggang sa
                naisipan ko na gumawa din ng sarili kong version ng chatGPT at i test kung paano nga ba talaga ito
                gumagana.
                Gamit ang API "Application Programming Interface" ng openAI ako ay nakagawa ng kagaya nito at natawa
                lang din ako sa part na marunong ito magmura. Syempre hindi ko kaya gumawa ng eksatong galing ng
                chatGPT. Matagal ito na train at napag-aralan ng mga Developer upang mapagana ng maayos</p>
