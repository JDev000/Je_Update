                <h1>How <span>Jerome Edica</span> became a Developer at his young age</h1>
                <h2>Dated Posted: May. 28, 2023</h2>
                <img src="./assets/prog-img.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>I am <i>"Jerome Edica"</i>, and even as a
                    child, I was already fond of computers. I started using a computer when <em>I was 7 years old</em>.
                    Because I
                    was mischievous in handling it, I ended up breaking my cousin's computer. Despite the things I
                    broke, I still managed to learn how to use it. Gaming was my passion when I was young, but I
                    continued to explore what else I could do with a computer. I even learned how to use Facebook at a
                    young age because I was curious about how technology works. As time went on, I learned more and was
                    able to do more. I also learned how to hack simple things like Wi-Fi when I was in elementary school
                    and how to find bugs in applications. I just recently discovered that it's called 'bug bounty,' and
                    I realized that there's a significant amount of money that can be earned from it. But it's okay
                    because at least I learned.

                    But how did I become a website developer or what they call a 'Front End Developer'? It started when
                    I was in Grade 9. I stopped studying in 2020, not only because of the pandemic caused by COVID-19,
                    but also because I couldn't afford to study in a private school. However, when I stopped, it didn't
                    occur to me to just rest all the time and watch or play games.

                    I thought about what I could do or what I wanted to learn to make good use of my time. I started
                    studying Ethical Hacking. I learned how to hack someone's basic identity, but of course, I was the
                    person I hacked. It was better to test it on myself for my own learning and not harm others. I also
                    learned how to create 3D models, basic animation, basic graphics, and other things because I also
                    enjoy designing houses and various things.

                    I stumbled upon website development when I became interested and serious about studying
                    cybersecurity. But of course, I'm not yet that skilled, and I'm still learning, so I'm still
                    curious. According to an article I read, learning website development is necessary, and there's a
                    point to it because if you know how to create a website, there's also a chance to learn how to
                    bypass one. And it's really important to learn Cybersecurity, at least the basics, so that we know
                    how to create a safe website.

                    I also proved that age doesn't matter when it comes to learning if you really want to learn. I
                    learned a lot on my journey, but I feel like I want to have companions or see people like me in this
                    field. That's why I thought of joining communities to grow alongside them and help each other
                    improve. That's where I met @Atcha_Abe, who became my elder sister in the community. Because of her,
                    I met many people, not just ordinary individuals, but big names in the IT field, and many skilled
                    individuals. This motivated me even more to work on projects to improve myself as well.</p>

                <h1>Life of a <span>Freelancer</span></h1>
                <h2>Dated Posted: May. 28, 2023</h2>
                <img src="./assets/article-img.png" alt="">
                <p id="big-artic"> <i>"Freelancing"</i> is a type of work that anyone can earn by selling their skills. An
                    example of this is what I do where I have the ability to create a website, design, write and
                    whatever else I ca>n earn if someone hires me. As a Freelancer I can say that it is not an easy job
                    because first it is difficult to get a client. You can't just get a client, especially if your
                    profile isn't good because that's what will be looked at and your projects that have already been
                    done. Proof that you know how to do what he asks you to do when you've proven your experience.
                    Creating a portfolio website will help to show other people the project you have done, to prove that
                    we can do those things and they can hire you for their project to do. The good thing about
                    Freelancing is that you own your time and you don't have to follow a leader, because you dictate
                    what you do. But your project should still be based on what your client is doing so that he can pay
                    you well and is it possible to give you a good comment and rate because of the quality you show. We
                    will use a laptop or cellphone and a stable internet connection, and we must know how to communicate
                    well with the client so that they can trust you and maybe come back to you to do the work again.

            <p><em>Disover</em> the power of 'AI', Year 2023 where I hear and see the wild
                features of chatGPT.
                It's trending on Tiktok, Facebook and other social media platforms, at first I laughed because
                AI they can communicate through chat
                and in their conversations that are funny as if they were just talking to someone. I tried to study it and found out
                whose name is OpenAI
                of the company that made chatGPT, it's really amazing what it can do. Until
                I thought to make my own version of chatGPT and test how it works
                works.
                Using openAI's "Application Programming Interface" API, I did something like this and had a good laugh
                I'm also the only one who knows how to swear. Of course I can't make an exact original
                chatGPT. It has been trained and studied for a long time by the Developers to work properly</p>
