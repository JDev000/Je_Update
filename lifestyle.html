            <p>Why do I want to be a Scientist or Computer Scientist? When I was a kid, I was so creative that sometimes
                I could say "Abert Einstein" one of the things I admire because of his extraordinary talent. It's
                inpsires his sayings and how they think. I also want to do something that will help us to improve our
                country. like questions I can't answer.

                The picture is my project made, I called it "Automatic Disinfectant Spray".
                Many have done it, but why did I do it? It helps me to learn when I'm
                I have experience in how to do it.
                I made mistakes several times until I made it. My advice to beginners is not to be afraid to make
                mistakes.
